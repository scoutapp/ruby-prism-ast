Understanding YARV and Instruction Sequences

Ruby compiles your source code into YARV bytecode before executing it. You can see this process directly using the `RubyVM::InstructionSequence` class.

In `ruby example.rb` we can see how Ruby code is compiled with Prism, inspect the generated bytecode, and run it.

```ruby
insns = RubyVM::InstructionSequence.compile_prism("puts 'HI WORLD'")
# => <RubyVM::InstructionSequence:<compiled>@<compiled>:1>
```

You can disassemble the instruction sequence to view the generated instructions:
```ruby
pp insns.disassemble
# == disasm: #<ISeq:<compiled>@<compiled>:1 (1,0)-(1,15)>
# 0000 putself
# 0001 putstring                      "HI WORLD"
# 0003 opt_send_without_block         <callinfo!mid:puts, argc:1, FCALL|ARGS_SIMPLE>
# 0005 leave
```

Or evaluate it directly:

```ruby
insns.eval
# HI WORLD
```
